# Closed-price-prediction-using-head-and-shoulders-pattern-ML-model
The MLP is implemented using Python and NumPy. It is configured with customizable parameters such as the number of input features, hidden layers, and the number of outputs. The training process involves forward propagation, backpropagation, and gradient descent.
The project outputs insights into potential trading opportunities based on the trained MLP model. The model's performance can be evaluated based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) during the training process
